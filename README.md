- **Smooth Animations**: Transition effects for switching between Sign In and Sign Up modes.
- **Social Media Integration**: Placeholder icons for social media login options.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository or download the code.
   ```bash
   git clone <git remote add origin https://github.com/KishanKumar1047/Login_Form.git>
   ```
2. Ensure you have the following files in the project directory:
   - `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure.
   - `styles.css`: Contains the CSS styles.
   - `script.js`: Contains the JavaScript for interactivity.

3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.

## How It Works
1. **Sign In Mode**:
   - By default, the form starts in Sign In mode.
   - Users can enter their username and password to log in.

2. **Sign Up Mode**:
   - Click the "Sign up" button to switch to the Sign Up form.
   - Users can enter their details to register.

3. **Toggle Between Modes**:
   - The JavaScript handles the toggling of classes (`sign-up-mode`) on the container element to switch forms dynamically.
